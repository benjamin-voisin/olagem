## Project description

A terminal-based typing speed test.

## Installation

Wherever you want, clone this git repo using the command
```
git clone https://github.com/Vneb23/olagem.git
```

If you don't have lua installed, you would need to install it. Go to lua.org for more information.

Then, just run the  command
```
sudo make install
```
and you'r done !

To start the program, type
```
olagem
```
in your terminal.

You can get help by typing
```
man olagem
```
in your terminal, or with the `-h` flag :
```
olagem -h
```

## State of the project

Working main program, but has many issues and some bugs. Needs a full rewrite (cpp or rust ?)

## Dependencies

This project currently needs lua to run (made in lua 5.3 but supposedly works in 5.1).
